# Portifier Audit – Executive Summary

Use this as a quick read; full details and file paths in `BUG_REPORT.md`.

## Highest Priority
- Fix SEO metadata bugs in `src/app/[username]/layout.js` (wrong `generateMetadata` usage, undefined `username` in catch).
- Fix `src/app/api/contact/route.js` to return 500 on failure and remove out-of-scope variable usage.
- Remove excessive client `console.log` calls before production; guard server logs by environment.
- In `backend/`, move JWT secret to ENV, remove duplicate `get_page_image`, and avoid global `current_pdf_document_id`.

## Medium
- Standardize brand naming across app (“Portifier”) and emails.
- Add `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` routes.
- Add reduced-motion and image optimization (next/image) on marketing pages.
- Add rate limiting & CSRF protections for auth, bug-report, contact.

## Low
- Audit and prune unused templates/assets; migrate legacy `next/head` usage; consider cloud storage for uploads.

## Environment
- Ensure `JWT_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI`, `EMAIL_*`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` set for Next.js; `MONGODB_URI`, `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `TESSERACT_CMD` for Flask.
