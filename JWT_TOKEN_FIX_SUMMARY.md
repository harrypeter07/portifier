# JWT Token Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The application was experiencing authentication failures with the error:
```
Cast to ObjectId failed for value "{
  buffer: {
    '0': 104,
    '1': 133,
    '2': 190,
    '3': 150,
    '4': 117,
    '5': 196,
    '6': 92,
    '7': 60,
    '8': 220,
    '9': 238,
    '10': 169,
    '11': 226
  }
}" (type Object) at path "_id" for model "User"
```

## Root Cause

The issue was that MongoDB ObjectIds were being stored directly in JWT tokens. When these ObjectIds are serialized and deserialized through the JWT process, they become Buffer objects instead of proper ObjectId strings, causing MongoDB queries to fail.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed JWT Token Creation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/auth/signin/route.js`
- `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Changed `userId: user._id` to `userId: user._id.toString()` when creating JWT tokens
- This ensures the ObjectId is stored as a string in the JWT payload

### 2. Fixed JWT Token Verification

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/auth.js`
- `src/app/api/portfolio/save.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `mongoose` import for ObjectId conversion
- Convert the userId string back to ObjectId before database queries:
  ```javascript
  const userId = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(payload.userId);
  const user = await User.findById(userId);
  ```

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/api/auth/signin/route.js**
   - Line 49: Changed `userId: user._id` to `userId: user._id.toString()`

2. **src/app/api/auth/signup/route.js**
   - Line 81: Changed `userId: user._id` to `userId: user._id.toString()`

3. **src/lib/auth.js**
   - Added mongoose import
   - Lines 26-27: Added ObjectId conversion before database query

4. **src/app/api/portfolio/save.js**
   - Added mongoose import
   - Line 17: Added ObjectId conversion for portfolio queries

## Testing

Created and ran a test script that verified:
- ObjectIds are properly converted to strings when creating JWT tokens
- String userIds are properly converted back to ObjectIds when verifying tokens
- The conversion process maintains data integrity

## Result

âœ… **Authentication now works correctly**
- JWT tokens are created with string userIds
- Token verification properly converts strings back to ObjectIds
- Database queries no longer fail with ObjectId casting errors
- Users can successfully authenticate and access protected routes

## Impact

This fix resolves the authentication issues that were preventing users from:
- Accessing the `/editor` route
- Using the `/api/auth/me` endpoint
- Saving portfolio data
- Maintaining session state across requests

The fix is backward compatible and doesn't require any database migrations or user data changes.
