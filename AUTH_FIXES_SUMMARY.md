# Authentication System Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Middleware Issues (`src/middleware.js`)
**Problems:**
- Using `jwt.verify` instead of `jwtVerify` from jose library
- Variable name mismatch (`isValidToken` vs `isAuthenticated`)
- Missing proper async/await handling
- Insufficient logging for debugging

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Updated to use `jwtVerify` from jose library
- ✅ Fixed variable naming consistency
- ✅ Made middleware function async
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Proper error handling with cookie cleanup

### 2. Sign-in Route Issues (`src/app/api/auth/signin/route.js`)
**Problems:**
- Using `jwt.sign` instead of `SignJWT` from jose
- Inconsistent response format
- Missing proper error handling
- Insufficient logging

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Updated to use `SignJWT` from jose library
- ✅ Standardized response format using `NextResponse.json`
- ✅ Added comprehensive try-catch error handling
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging
- ✅ Improved error messages

### 3. Sign-up Route Issues (`src/app/api/auth/signup/route.js`)
**Problems:**
- Not automatically logging in user after signup
- No JWT token generation after successful registration
- Missing comprehensive logging

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Added automatic login after successful signup
- ✅ JWT token generation and cookie setting
- ✅ Enhanced logging throughout the process
- ✅ Improved error handling and validation logging

### 4. Auth Library Issues (`src/lib/auth.js`)
**Problems:**
- Duplicate imports
- Using `jsonwebtoken` instead of jose
- Missing database connection
- Insufficient logging

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Removed duplicate imports
- ✅ Updated to use `jwtVerify` from jose
- ✅ Added database connection
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

### 5. Frontend Issues
**Sign-in Page (`src/app/auth/signin/page.jsx`):**
- ✅ Fixed function name mismatch (`checkAuth` → `checkLoggedIn`)
- ✅ Added missing state variables (`showPassword`, `verifiedMsg`)
- ✅ Added success message display for email verification
- ✅ Removed duplicate error display

**Sign-up Page (`src/app/auth/signup/page.jsx`):**
- ✅ Updated to handle automatic login after signup
- ✅ Added redirect to dashboard after successful registration
- ✅ Improved user experience with success message

### 6. Additional Improvements
**Logout Route (`src/app/api/auth/logout/route.js`):**
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging
- ✅ Better error handling

**/me Route (`src/app/api/auth/me/route.js`):**
- ✅ Added request parameter to auth function call
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Login After Signup
- Users are now automatically logged in after successful registration
- JWT token is created and set as an HTTP-only cookie
- Redirect to dashboard after signup completion

### 2. Comprehensive Logging
- Added detailed logging throughout all authentication flows
- Log prefixes for easy identification: `[SIGNUP]`, `[SIGNIN]`, `[AUTH]`, `[MIDDLEWARE]`, etc.
- Logs include user actions, errors, and authentication states

### 3. Consistent JWT Implementation
- Standardized on jose library for all JWT operations
- Proper token creation with expiration times
- Secure cookie settings with httpOnly and sameSite

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Proper try-catch blocks in all async operations
- Consistent error response formats
- Better error messages for debugging

## Testing

A test script (`test-auth.js`) has been created to verify:
1. User registration with automatic login
2. Authentication state verification
3. Sign-in functionality
4. Logout functionality
5. Post-logout authentication state

## Security Improvements

1. **HTTP-Only Cookies**: JWT tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
2. **Secure Cookie Settings**: Cookies are set with appropriate security flags
3. **Proper Token Verification**: Using jose library for secure JWT verification
4. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are properly hashed using bcrypt
5. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs

## Usage

### Sign Up Flow
1. User fills out registration form
2. System validates input and checks for existing users
3. Password is hashed and user is created
4. JWT token is automatically generated and set as cookie
5. User is redirected to dashboard

### Sign In Flow
1. User provides email and password
2. System validates credentials
3. JWT token is generated and set as cookie
4. User is redirected to dashboard

### Authentication Middleware
- Protects routes: `/dashboard`, `/editor`
- Redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in page
- Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages
- Provides comprehensive logging for debugging

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set:
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication system thoroughly
2. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
3. Consider adding rate limiting for auth endpoints
4. Implement password reset functionality if needed
5. Add email verification if required
